* conversions

<br />

### Planning to be added
* user made functions
* classes?
* datatype function
* multi datatype lists
* inline interpretable settings

<br />

### Long Term Project
Build Granular into a compilable language after building out the foundation. Able to write multi-line files to be compiled and executed. 

<br />

### How to run:

1. Download & install [C++](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds)
    ##### *mac already comes with
